# Bookmarks
A simple Bookmarks home page for your browser. It needs xampp on startup.

Set up xampp on startup and localhost/bookmarks/index.php as a home page on your browser. 
You can change the background image and varius colors in the page.
There is a textarea for taking notes that are saved in local storage, a list of your bookmarks links and a fast access list of your links displayed with png images of your choosing. 
There is a drop down tool box to manage all these changes. You can add bookmarks in a drop down list or place them in the home page as link images. You can delete them and change the colors of the page.

Open the screenshots in the repository and se how it looks after the setup. The images in the screenshot are located in the .zip file if you want to use them.
