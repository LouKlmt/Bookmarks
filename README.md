# Bookmarks
A simple Bookmarks home page for your browser. It needs xampp on startup.

Set up xampp on startup and localhost/bookmarks/index.php as a home page on your browser. 
You can change the background image and varius colors in the page.
There is a textarea for taking notes that are saved in local storage, a list of your bookmarks links and a fast access list of your links displayed with png images of your choosing. 
There is a drop down tool box to manage all these changes. You can add bookmarks in a drop down list or place them in the home page as link images. You can delete them and change the colors of the page.
